Our legal bases for processing under EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or any equivalent legislation is described above in the sections entitled “Purposes of Personal Information Processing Activities.” We may process your Personal Information if you consent to the processing, to satisfy our legal obligations, if it is necessary to carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we entered with you or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract with you, or for legitimate interests, such as improving our Services, monitoring trends and developing new products.

### Direct Marketing

If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and a current customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (email or SMS) with information about our Services that are similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale or negotiations of a sale to you.

You have the right to withdraw that consent at any time by using the unsubscribe options in the email marketing communications sent by us.

### Individual Rights

EEA Residents have the following rights, which can be exercised by contacting us at [support@acuriousmind.com](mailto:support@acuriousmind.com) so that we may consider your request under applicable law.

You have the right to request access to your Personal Information. This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. You can also access and change any Personal Information we store through your account page. You have the right to request the correction of any Personal Information we hold about you, and to request erasure of your Personal Information data. You have the right to object to your Personal Information being processed by us where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party). Where your Personal Information is processed on the basis of your consent, you have a right to withdraw your consent at any time by notifying us, but this will not affect the lawfulness of processing by Company based on consent given by you before the time consent has been withdrawn. You have the right to request that we suspend the processing of Personal Information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it. If you do ask us to delete or stop processing your Personal Information, we will not always be required to do so. If this is the case, we will explain why.

You also have the right to request the transfer your Personal Information to another service provider or a third party. This right only applies in certain circumstances. Where it does not apply, we will explain why.

The rights described above may be limited by local laws. Further, your right of access and deletion is not absolute and may not be available if fulfillment of such right would, among other things:

- cause interference with execution and enforcement of the law and legal private rights (such as in the case of the investigation or detection of offenses and legal claims or the right to a fair trial);
- breach or prejudice the rights of confidentiality and security of others;
- prejudice security or grievance investigations, corporate re-organizations, future and ongoing negotiations with third parties, the compliance with regulatory requirements relating to economic and financial management; or
