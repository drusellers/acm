_And you still have to build it._

If you choose to deploy outside of a PaaS, then you need to sit down and figure out your networking story. How are you going to manage DNS, network security, email configuration, delayed jobs, and more. Maybe you chose Kubernetes and now you are trying to wrap your head around all of these new nouns like: Pod, NodePort, and PersistentVolume.

My goal is to cut through all of the noise and help your team establish a common framework. Building on top of your previous decisions we will establish a common framework that will let your team work with confidence.
