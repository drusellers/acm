# We build complex systems

A modern business process requires complex systems, but they needn't be complicated.

<Definition term="Complex">
    A system that is composed of mulitple other systems

<Definition term="Complicated">
    consisting of many interconnecting parts or elements; intricate
</Definition>

New people always want to ask "Why" when they encounter a new system that doesn't match their mindset. I'm no different, I want to understand your processes down to the core. I want to understand how your sales process, impacts your End of Month close. I want to understand how your billing processes, impact your software development processes.

# It's Dangerous to go Alone

We all love a simple story. A quick prompt in ChatGPT, grab the code and then back to what we were doing. However, building out a modern application is still more than a single sentence prompt in your LLM of choice.

Today's applications are composed of an absurd amount of moving parts.

[//]: # (Even a simple application can be composed of an absurd amount of moving parts. Today, the typical developer is choosing a programming language, a database, a source control system, which cloud they are going to deploy on, which services to bet on, and the joys of HTML and CSS.)

_And you still have to build it._

If you choose to deploy outside of a PaaS, then you need to sit down and figure out your networking story. How are you going to manage DNS, network security, email configuration, delayed jobs, and more. Maybe you chose Kubernetes and now you are trying to wrap your head around all of these new nouns like: Pod, NodePort, and PersistentVolume.

My goal is to cut through all of the noise and help your team establish a common framework. Building on top of your previous decisions we will establish a common framework that will let your team work with confidence.
