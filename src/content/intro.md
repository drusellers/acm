# Be Curious

Over the years, one of my mantra's, as a self-taught developer, is that "there is no magic in software." In the end, everything in a program happens for a reason. It might be buried in 17 layers of gunk, but in the end it's right there. Staring at you. 

There is something rewarding about grabbing your "keyboard and a flashlight" and diving head first into the mess. Finding your way through the muck, to gaze upon the solution. Doesn't matter if its an accounting system, a software system, or a business process.

Now, after two decades of doing this, you get to benefit from years of me asking "Why?" and generally being persistent until I understand. These software and human systems make sense to me, and are a continual curiosity for me, always leading me into new areas.

Something that feels unique to me after these years, is that I see software development as a means to study business. Much like Conway's law states, I enjoy seeing how the departments and processes of a company impact and/or impacted by the software systems.
