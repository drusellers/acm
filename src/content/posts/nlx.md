    eyebrow: 'evolving terminology'
    tease: >
      Like any new technology, a new way of thinking, it's helpful to have a specific term for what we're discussing. And this idea of a natural language experience is a perfect fit for a prompt-based world.

My buddy Brian at [The Search Bar](https://thesearchbar.ai/) was talking to me about the new term NLX (Natural Language Experience). I always love me some new terminology and this is no exception. I wanted to put on my semantic hat and explore what I think this is trying to get at and what I would do in my professional life to take this to heart.

- [NLX is the new UX](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nlx-natural-language-experience-new-ux-sakshi-guraba-xn1zc/)

And I want to think about how I might go about taking the lesson from these posts and changing the way that I build my applications.

To this end, I'm currently working on an application to help fitness coaches build their programming for their clients. And I'm curious to think about this natural language experience in terms of that tool.

```js
navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })
  .then(function(stream) {
    // Use the stream here (e.g., create an audio recorder)
    console.log('Microphone access granted.');
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error('Error accessing microphone:', err);
  });
```


Now that we are able to do more prompting as a way of invoking our application to do something, let's talk about the developer preference for command bar executions. and I'm thinking about Raycast / Alfred / etc

The power of voice and our ability to understand voice and extract out structured data to interpret intent.

Now that we can better extract structured meaning from voice, how do we start to use that rather than typing our fingers?

Can we think about this in a world where you're in an office versus where you're at home?
