## Overview

An existing digital signage solution was experiencing long outages, and
and multiple bugs. This application is prominantely displayed in stores
on screens ranging from 55" to 98" in size.

## Process

The real work for this project was to stabalize the application. So that it would work
reliably. Once I was given access to the source code, I started to hunt down the problem. The issue ended up being centered on a common JavaScript issue where a member's name had changed and was causing an issue in a recursive function. Because it was in this function, the issue wasn't immediately apparent.


> [!INFO]
> Another team had tried to take over the project but stated that it needed to be completely re-written in order to achieve the goals of stability and modernization. As some one who loves a good brownfield application, I was hired to do those things without the immediate re-write.

This was an older system that had been through three different "generations" of
JavaScript / Node - after stabilizing the current iteration of the application, I worked
on bringing the code base "up-to-code". Overtime, systems will experience bit-rot as
technology marches on. By deliberately targeting each change I was able to modernize the
code base while reacting to new bugs identified by the applications increased usage.

- Moved on to LTS version of Node
- Updated NPM packages
- Standardized on `async`/`await` rather than a convoluted nest of `for` loops with recursive functions
- Slowly converting each file to TypeScript, as new bugs were found
