# Automating Drudgery

<Outcomes outcomes={[
    'Automated manual system for provisioning new cloud resources',
    'Time to deployment was reduced from 24 hrs to 5 minutes'
    ]} />

## Overview

Built and deployed a system to automate the process of provisioning
cloud resources based on customer requests.

## Processes

This was a full stack system. Not only did this system support connecting to a
customer's private cloud, but would spin up servers, included a concept of
bootstrapping servers, running and installing software of multiple variations.

- package deployment (shipit -> depo)
- package and release tracking
- network creation and deployment
- multi-cloud
- local daemon to pull updates (depot-agent)
- local cli to automate remote http actions
- fault tolerent
- instance abstraction
- bootstrapping
- configuration data (by environment)
- cloud
  - load balancer management
  - white labeled DNS

### Releasing new Code

- software packaging and a repository (in-house format)

### Configuration Data

Alternatives would have been etcd, counsul, cloud native options like Azure Key Vault, AWS SSM Parameter Store. We wanted something that was multi-cloud, and wouldn't require a cloud specific security credential.
