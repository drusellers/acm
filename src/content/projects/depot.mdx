# Automating Drudgery

<Goals goals={[
    'Automate the manual system for provisioning new cloud resources',
    'Reduce response time'
    ]} />

## Outcomes

- Process moved from a manual process to an automated system
- Time to deployment was reduced from 24 hrs to 5 minutes

## Overview

Build and deploy a system to automated a manual process for provisioning cloud resources using a secure approach. Built on top of an existing abstraction, that was extended to achieve new capabilities.


This was a full stack system. Not only did this system support connecting to a customer's private cloud, but would spin up servers, included a concept of bootstrapping servers, running and installing software of multiple variations.

## Sub-systems


- package deployment (shipit -> depo)
- package and release tracking
- network creation and deployment
- load balancer management
- multi-cloud
- local daemon to pull updates (depot-agent)
- local cli to automate remote http actions
- fault tolerent
- white labeled DNS
- instance abstraction
- bootstrapping
- configuration data (by environment)

## Processes

### Releasing new Code

- software packaging and a repository (shipit format)

### Configuration Data

Alternatives would have been etcd, counsul, cloud native options like Azure Key Vault, AWS SSM Parameter Store. We wanted something that was multi-cloud, and wouldn't require a cloud specific security credential.

### Putting it all together
