# Documentation

<Outcomes outcomes={['A',
    'B']} />

It would not shock anyone to say that 2023-2025 were buzz years for Generative AI and LLMs. While helping many teams figure out their approach to LLM usage and ways to further their strategic goals I wanted to try those same tools on a knowledge base that I knew well, the [MassTransit](https://masstransit.io/) documentation.

<Callout title={'MassTransit'} level={'info'}>
    MassTransit is an open source project that I started with
    Chris Patterson (PhatBoyG) 12 years ago to build a distributed
    processing system in .NET.
