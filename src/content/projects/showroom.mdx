This project was to build a streamlined front end for the company's ERP system that would enable retail sales staff to quickly create quotes for customers. The goal was to make Sales Reps more efficient by not having to work through a clunky and antiquated ERP system.

A unique feature of this system was that it leveraged a physical scanning device like you might have used during a gift registry trip. A customer could walk around, anonymous and build a shopping cart of sorts. They could then get a print out of the items they scanned, and if they so wanted it could be emailed to this. Capturing this email was a key goal, which helped retail stores track customer behavior.

If the email address was a known email address, the customer could then take that order and checkout at a later time. There were also future goals of creating a universal cart that would let you shop in store, and checkout on the web later.

Towards the end of my engagement on the project, we were even successful in executing a zero downtime migration to the company's new ERP system, maintaining quotes, customers, and other reference data.

This project was a fun challenge because it blended together mulitple business systems including ERPs, E-Commerce systems, and marketing tools.
