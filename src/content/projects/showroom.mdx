# Custom Retail ERP Front End

<Outcomes outcomes={['Identify Anonymous Customers for further marketing efforts',
    'Increase the efficiency of their Sales Staff']} />

## Overview

The current ERP requires a customer before generating a quote. This means that a customer that is just browsing would
have to commit to giving you a lot of personal information, if all they want is a list of items that they
were interested in.

## Solution

We built an application that leveraged our existing API from a previous project, to capture a
light weight "quote" which was like an Amazon Wishlist. The user could walk around the
store scanning products and before leaving could have it printed out. We also offered
the option to email the customer a PDF, which would then get that customer into the
company's <abbr title="Customer Data Platform">CDP</abbr>.

With the shopping intent captured, a customer could come back with the "quote" number,
and we could pick back up on the shopping trip. If the customer, had it emailed to them,
then we could look it up by email address too.

A unique feature of this system was that it leveraged a physical scanning device
like you might have used during a gift registry trip. A customer could walk around,
anonymous and build a shopping cart of sorts. They could then get a print out of the
items they scanned, and if they so wanted it could be emailed to this. Capturing this
email was a key goal, which helped retail stores track customer behavior.

If the email address was a known email address, the customer could then take that order and
checkout at a later time. There were also future goals of creating a universal cart that would
let you shop in store, and checkout on the web later.

Towards the end of my engagement on the project, we were even successful in executing a zero
downtime migration to the company's new ERP system, maintaining quotes, customers, and other
reference data.

This project was a fun challenge because it blended together mulitple business systems including
ERPs, E-Commerce systems, and marketing tools.
