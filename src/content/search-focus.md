  title: Helping humans and machines misunderstand each other less
  bits:
    - headline: Humans are Silly
      copy: We don’t search the way we think we do — we type feelings, fragments, and half-memories. Understanding that gap is where great search begins.
    - headline: Machines are Literal
      copy: Search engines only return what they can understand. We help you bridge that divide with better indexing, relevance tuning, and feedback loops.
    - headline: Interfaces are Conversations
      copy: The search box isn’t a feature — it’s a dialogue. We design interfaces that listen, guide, and reward curiosity.
